# Jakorta

Jakorta is a card game invented by Avinash Belliyappa and Ben Leadbetter. 
Set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, players must collaborate to try and escape the overlord Jakorta.


This is my attempt at developing the digital platform for the game.
It is definitely still a work in progress. The actual digital game is still far from playable.

The current biggest thing to implement is a GameState class, employing the State design pattern, allowing the game to navigate the complex web of different phases that the game goes through. (I will upload my hand drawn diagram very soon).

I'm also working on some lino-cuts for the card art.

Feel free to snoop!
